# Integration Tests #

Definition:

Integration testing is a type of software testing where components of the software are 
gradually integrated and then tested as a unified group. Usually these components are 
already working well individually, but they may break when integrated with other components. 
With integration testing, testers want to find defects that surface due to code conflicts 
between software modules when they are integrated with each other.

Benefits:
- A software is built from a complex network of subcomponents. With integration testing, 
we ensure that they work together in harmony, delivering the intended functionalities.
- Modern software must also connect with a wide variety of external systems via APIs to 
deliver specific functionalities, and conflicts can also happen with them, requiring 
integration testing.
- Verify the flow of data and information throughout the entire system.
- Increased confidence in system behavior especially if it is performed early in the 
testing life cycle, following the shift left testing approach.
